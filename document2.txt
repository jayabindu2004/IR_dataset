The increasing urbanization and vehicular growth have intensified parking challenges, prompting research into advanced parking management systems. Traditional methods relying on manual monitoring or static sensors often fail to meet modern needs, leading to the adoption of computer vision and deep learning technologies. YOLO (You Only Look Once) and its variants (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8) have emerged as key solutions for real-time vehicle detection and parking slot monitoring. These models achieve high speed and accuracy, with enhancements such as Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and ResNet backbones further improving detection precision in diverse conditions.

IoT-enabled systems integrating sensors, cloud platforms, and mobile applications offer practical solutions for real-time parking management. Innovative approaches like integrating YOLO with reinforcement learning, SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking), and perspective transformation have shown potential for robust and scalable systems. Furthermore, sustainable solutions incorporating renewable energy and energy-efficient hardware, such as Raspberry Pi, address environmental concerns while optimizing operational efficiency.

Research has explored various applications, including YOLOv5 with angled viewpoint detection and 2D modeling for flexible and accurate parking management. Other studies leveraged YOLOv7 with stereoscopic ranging and STM32 microcontrollers to enhance responsiveness and depth calculation in complex scenarios. Additionally, YOLO-based systems integrated with OpenCV and IoT frameworks have enabled automated payment and alert systems, improving user convenience.

However, challenges such as scalability, adaptability to diverse environments, and real-world validation persist. Innovations like anchor-free configurations in YOLOv5 and Bayesian optimization techniques in YOLOv7 address issues of accuracy and computational efficiency but require further exploration for nighttime and high-density scenarios.

Future research should focus on integrating advanced features, such as dynamic slot allocation, reservation systems, and mobile app-based user engagement, to enhance scalability and real-time adaptability. Leveraging transfer learning, edge computing, and hybrid cloud models can also reduce computational demands and improve system autonomy. These advancements aim to optimize parking space utilization, reduce congestion, and align with smart city initiatives for sustainable urban development.
