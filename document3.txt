The integration of computer vision and deep learning technologies has revolutionized traffic monitoring systems, as demonstrated in various research works. Traditional approaches to Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), such as edge detection and filtering, have been supplemented by deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low lighting and distorted angles. Advanced methodologies like Adaptive Fusion Feature Segmentation Networks (AFF-Net) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have further improved license plate localization and correction capabilities in complex environments.

Deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) have shown significant potential in vehicle detection and classification. YOLO’s real-time processing capabilities have been employed in diverse tasks, including vehicle speed estimation and accident detection. For instance, YOLOv5 combined with StrongSORT tracking has been effective in vehicle classification and speed monitoring, achieving high accuracy while categorizing vehicles into distinct types like cars, motorcycles, and trucks. Similarly, accident detection systems leveraging YOLO and trajectory analysis have demonstrated the ability to identify collision events and trigger emergency notifications efficiently, albeit with the need for further improvements in robustness under low-light and high-density traffic scenarios.

IoT-enabled smart parking solutions, such as “Eco Park,” integrate sensors and real-time data processing to optimize parking space utilization. These systems’ reliance on deep learning models, including YOLO and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), facilitates accurate parking space detection and allocation under varying conditions. GANs have also been applied to enhance low-resolution license plate images, improving overall recognition performance in real-world scenarios.

Innovations like Shared Adversarial Training Networks (SATNs) and Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) address issues of image noise, perspective distortion, and environmental variability. Additionally, approaches using MobileNet and SDD-MobileNet have provided lightweight yet effective solutions for rapid license plate detection in fast-moving vehicles.

These advancements underline the transformative role of deep learning and computer vision in modern traffic systems. However, challenges remain, including scalability, integration with smart city infrastructure, and adaptability to diverse traffic environments. Future research should focus on refining detection models, enhancing interoperability, and leveraging predictive analytics for a more comprehensive and proactive traffic management system.

Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems have significantly evolved, integrating advanced methodologies to address challenges in diverse traffic scenarios. Traditional approaches relied on image processing techniques, such as filtering and edge detection, which often struggled with variations in lighting, weather, and perspective distortions. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have enhanced the robustness of ALPR systems. These models, such as Shared Adversarial Training Networks (SATN), tackle environmental distortions and perspective issues by employing dual attention transformation modules.

Vehicle detection and tracking have also seen considerable improvements. YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models, particularly versions 5 and 7, demonstrate high accuracy and speed in identifying and classifying vehicles. Enhanced algorithms like StrongSORT enable effective vehicle tracking across frames, facilitating functionalities such as speed detection and vehicle counting. These methods ensure reliable performance even in dynamic and congested urban settings.

Accident detection systems have incorporated deep learning models, utilizing YOLOv5 and centroid tracking to analyze anomalies in trajectory, speed, and acceleration. These solutions have proven effective, achieving detection rates up to 71%, although challenges remain in minimizing false positives and handling adverse weather conditions.

Smart parking systems, such as Eco Park, leverage IoT and computer vision to provide real-time parking availability. These systems integrate prediction algorithms and dynamic pricing, reducing congestion and enhancing user convenience. Furthermore, Super Resolution GANs (SRGAN) have been employed to enhance the clarity of low-quality images, benefiting applications in license plate recognition and vehicle classification.

Despite these advancements, challenges persist. Systems often rely on high-quality video feeds, which can be impacted by poor lighting or environmental conditions. Computational demands also pose limitations, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Future research must address these gaps by improving algorithm robustness, expanding dataset diversity, and integrating multi-camera views for enhanced spatial coverage.

To further innovate, researchers could focus on merging ALPR systems with broader traffic management solutions. This includes detecting pedestrian behaviors, integrating with smart city infrastructure, and deploying cloud-based platforms for scalability. By addressing current limitations and exploring new avenues, these technologies can significantly contribute to safer and more efficient urban traffic systems.
