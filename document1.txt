The integration of computer vision and deep learning technologies has revolutionized traffic monitoring systems, as demonstrated in various research works. Traditional approaches to Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), such as edge detection and filtering, have been supplemented by deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low lighting and distorted angles. Advanced methodologies like Adaptive Fusion Feature Segmentation Networks (AFF-Net) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have further improved license plate localization and correction capabilities in complex environments.

Deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) have shown significant potential in vehicle detection and classification. YOLO’s real-time processing capabilities have been employed in diverse tasks, including vehicle speed estimation and accident detection. For instance, YOLOv5 combined with StrongSORT tracking has been effective in vehicle classification and speed monitoring, achieving high accuracy while categorizing vehicles into distinct types like cars, motorcycles, and trucks. Similarly, accident detection systems leveraging YOLO and trajectory analysis have demonstrated the ability to identify collision events and trigger emergency notifications efficiently, albeit with the need for further improvements in robustness under low-light and high-density traffic scenarios.

IoT-enabled smart parking solutions, such as “Eco Park,” integrate sensors and real-time data processing to optimize parking space utilization. These systems’ reliance on deep learning models, including YOLO and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), facilitates accurate parking space detection and allocation under varying conditions. GANs have also been applied to enhance low-resolution license plate images, improving overall recognition performance in real-world scenarios.

Innovations like Shared Adversarial Training Networks (SATNs) and Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) address issues of image noise, perspective distortion, and environmental variability. Additionally, approaches using MobileNet and SDD-MobileNet have provided lightweight yet effective solutions for rapid license plate detection in fast-moving vehicles.

These advancements underline the transformative role of deep learning and computer vision in modern traffic systems. However, challenges remain, including scalability, integration with smart city infrastructure, and adaptability to diverse traffic environments. Future research should focus on refining detection models, enhancing interoperability, and leveraging predictive analytics for a more comprehensive and proactive traffic management system.
